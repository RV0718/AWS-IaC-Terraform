# ECS AWS Fargate

[AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc&fargate-blogs.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&fargate-blogs.sort-order=desc) is a serverless compute engine that works with both [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc&ecs-blogs.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&ecs-blogs.sort-order=desc) and [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc&eks-blogs.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&eks-blogs.sort-order=desc) (EKS). This technology removes the need to equip and manage servers. This way we only use the resources needed by the application and improve security throughout application isolation.

AWS Fargate isnâ€™t available in all regions. To work with it, first verify its availability in your working region. Check the AWS documentation for more information regarding this matter. This article uses the European (Ireland) region as an example: eu-west-1.
